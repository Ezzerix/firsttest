A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.

A state is a compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a 
monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory.

In law, force means unlawful violence, or lawful compulsion.

When something is said to have been done "by force", it usually implies that it was done by actual 
or threatened violence ("might"), not necessarily by legal authority ("right").
